"Color Kanji" is an art project based on converting Word2Vec word embeddings to RGB, with several different projects:

"Lennon Wall" is a project based around using LIHKG forum posts from 2019-2020 to create Word2Vec word embeddings for individual characters of popular Hong Kong slogans, then reduce the dimensionality to RGB to create colored squares for each character in the slogans similar to Hong Kong "Lennon Walls".

"Puzzle Book" uses the collected works of a particular author to make author-specific word embeddings, convert them to RGB, and then "translate" one of their books to Color Kanji. Could be used as a printed art book or a complex digital Natural Language Processing puzzle to solve by re-translating the text to plain English.
