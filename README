"Color Kanji" is an art project based on converting Word2Vec word embeddings to HSL, with several different subprojects:

"Lennon Wall" is a project based around using a database from Cantonese Wikipedia to create Word2Vec word embeddings for individual characters of popular Hong Kong slogans, then reduce the dimensionality to HSL to create colored squares for each character in the slogans similar to Hong Kong "Lennon Walls".

WIP: "Puzzle Book" uses the collected works of a particular author to make author-specific word embeddings, convert them to HSL, and then "translate" one of their books to colored squares.
